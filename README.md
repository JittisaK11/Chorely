## **Overall Project Concept**
Chorely is a social task-management app designed to make chore completion and planning a collaborative experience. By blending productivity with social engagement, Chorely helps users stay organized and connected with friends while working on everyday chores and tasks. With features inspired by social apps like Partiful and Stompers, Chorely brings a fun and community-driven approach to staying organized.

## **Key Features**
- **Task Posting and Scheduling**: Users can easily post their chores or tasks, set times, and specify locations. This feature supports a wide range of tasks, including grocery shopping and study sessions, as well as the option to create their own custom tasks.
- **Social Engagement**: Friends on Chorely can view each other’s schedules, join in on tasks, and leave comments to coordinate plans. 
- **Location Integration**: With features from Mapkit, users can set locations for tasks, enabling friends to locate each other for shared activities.
Progress Tracking: Chorely provides insights into productivity by tracking the number of completed vs. pending tasks. Users can view weekly or daily stats.

## **Project Goals**
The goal of Chorely is to transform everyday tasks into shared experiences, making chore management more enjoyable. By combining task management with social connection, Chorely encourages users to stay productive while supporting each other.
